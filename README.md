# SDA-Capstone1


### This project entails typical Analytical Data Engineering, involving the ingestion of data from various sources and its loading into the Snowflake data warehouse. Within the warehouse, after undergoing a series of data transformation processes, we prepare the data for Business Intelligence (BI) usage. The BI tool Metabase connects to the data warehouse to generate diverse dashboards and reports.

#### 1- AWS S3 bucket
create an AWS Lambda that contains the python script using AWS ECR Docker container image to make connection between the s3 bucket and Snowflake data warehouse. 



#### 2-Postgres database on AWS RDS
Create EC2 instance to install Airbyte.



### End of part one : Extracting the data from the two sources (AWS RDS Postgres - AWS S3 bucket)  and storing it in Snowflake data warehouse.
