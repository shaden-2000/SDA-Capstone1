# SDA-Capstone1


### This project entails typical Analytical Data Engineering, involving the ingestion of data from various sources and its loading into the Snowflake data warehouse. Within the warehouse, after undergoing a series of data transformation processes, we prepare the data for Business Intelligence (BI) usage. The BI tool Metabase connects to the data warehouse to generate diverse dashboards and reports.
